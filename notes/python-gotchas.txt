.join() -> function takes in an interable and joins all the items at once. It is not useful for joining each item, returned out of for loop.

lower(), upper(), islower(), isupper() are not in place function. Meaning, they do return a value.

If an attribute (variable) needs to be called inside of another function in a class object, you have to reference it by self.
If the parameter is called inside of the same function, it doesn't need to have self.

class Circle():

    pi = 3.14

    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
        self.area = radius*radius*Circle.pi

    def get_circum(self):
        return self.radius * Circle.pi *2
