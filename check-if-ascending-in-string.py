If using method 1, the trick is to filter only the digits and compare i+1, 
whre i is initialized to 0 with the next consecutive number in the list.

Method 2 involves utilizing only other int var which takes less memory and does
two nested if checks, if the item in the for loop is a digit but previous is none
and if it is a digit but previous is not None. This way, you would start from
the 1st element of the list.
